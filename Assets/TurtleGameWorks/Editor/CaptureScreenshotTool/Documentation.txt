Introduction

The Capture Screenshot Tool is a Unity Editor extension developed by Turtle Game Works.
This tool provides a convenient way to capture screenshots within the Unity Editor with customizable settings.
It allows you to define a specific folder path to save the screenshots and provides a default path as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation

To install the Capture Screenshot Tool, follow these steps:
1. Open your Unity project.
2. Go to the project's Assets folder.
3. Create a new folder (if not already present) and name it "Editor" (without quotes).
4. Open the "Editor" folder.
5. Create a new C# script file in the "Editor" folder.
6. Copy the provided code into the script file.
7. Save the script file with an appropriate name, such as "CaptureScreenshotTool.cs".
8. Unity will automatically compile the script and make the tool available within the Unity Editor.

Tool Description

The Capture Screenshot Tool is comprised of two parts: the screenshot capture logic and the settings provider.


Screenshot Capture Logic

The `CaptureScreenshotTool` class contains the core logic for capturing screenshots.
It provides a menu item that can be accessed through "TurtleGameWorks/Capture Screenshot" or by pressing the assigned shortcut key (F11 by default).
When triggered, the tool captures a screenshot of the Game view and saves it as a PNG file.

The captured screenshot file is named in the following format: `<ProductName>_<DateTime>.png`.
The `<ProductName>` is the name of your Unity project, and `<DateTime>` represents the date and time when the screenshot was taken (in the format "yyyymmddhhmmss").

By default, the tool saves the captured screenshots to a specified path. If the path is not set or is empty, it falls back to a default path located in the user's "Screenshots" folder.


Settings Provider

The `CaptureScreenshotSettingsProvider` class is responsible for providing a custom settings interface within the Unity Editor.
It allows users to configure the screenshot capture path and provides a button to reset the path to the default value.

The settings interface can be accessed through "Edit/Project Settings/TurtleGameWorks/Capture Screenshot" or by searching for "Capture Screenshot" in the Unity Editor's search bar.
Within the settings interface, you can specify a custom folder path or use the default path for saving screenshots.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to Use

To use the Capture Screenshot Tool in Unity, follow these steps:


Capturing a Screenshot

1. Open your Unity project.
2. Make sure the Game view is visible and focused.

4. The tool will capture a screenshot of the Game view and save it to the specified or default folder path.
5. The file will be named in the format `<ProductName>_<DateTime>.png`.
6. The file path where the screenshot is saved will be displayed in the Unity Console.


Changing the Screenshot Path

1. Open your Unity project.
2. Go to "Edit/Project Settings/TurtleGameWorks/Capture Screenshot" or search for "Capture Screenshot" in the Unity Editor's search bar.
3. In the settings interface, you will see a text field labeled "Screenshot Path".
4. Enter a custom folder path where you want to save the screenshots.
5. Press Enter to apply the new path.
6. The tool will save future screenshots to the specified folder path.


Resetting to Default Path

3. In the settings interface, you will see a button labeled "Reset to Default".
4. Click the "Reset to Default" button to reset the screenshot path to the default value.
5. The default path is located in the user's "Screenshots" folder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customization

The Capture Screenshot Tool allows for customization of the following aspects:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shortcut Key

By default, the tool is set to use the F11 key as the shortcut for capturing a screenshot.
However, you can modify the shortcut key by changing the `[MenuItem(KMenuPath + " _F11")]` attribute in the code.
Replace `" _F11"` with the desired key combination. For example, use `" %#F11"` for the Ctrl + F11 combination.


Default Screenshot Path

The tool provides a default screenshot path located in the user's "Screenshots" folder.
If you prefer a different default path, you can modify it by changing the `GetDefaultPath()` method in the code.
Update the `defaultPath` variable to the desired default folder path.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the Capture Screenshot Tool, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Ensure that the Capture Screenshot Tool script is placed in the "Editor" folder within your Unity project's Assets folder.
2. Check that the Unity Editor is in Play mode or Game view is visible and focused before capturing a screenshot.
3. Verify that the specified or default folder path for saving screenshots is valid and accessible.
4. Make sure you have sufficient permissions to create and write files in the specified folder path.

If the issue persists, you can seek further assistance from the Turtle Game Works support team or consult the Unity forums for additional guidance.
